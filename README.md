# Arduino.Pentair
Arduino code for Pentair Intelliflo Wisperflo VSD

## How to install
* Copy the contents of the libraries folder to your Arduino folder under and merge with the existing libraries folder.
* Copy the pentair_driver_v2 to the arduino folder
* Open the .ino file from the pentair_driver_v2 folder in your Arduino IDE

## Notes

I still need to test this on a real system, 
my own pentair pump sends nothing over the RS485 wire, can someone confirm me how to connect it directly to the pump?
